# MobioTrip (In progress)
a trip managment project, still working on it.

## To build this repo:
I don't like the `requirements.txt` file, because it may have many conflicts.
For this reason, just install the following liberaries, and everything gonna be alright.

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)  (The main framework)
For Linux devices:
> python -m pip install Django==5.0.4

For Windows devices:
> py -m pip install Django==5.0.4

### [Django Rest Framework(DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
the main liberary:
> pip install djangorestframework

to build convenient filtering system
> pip install django-filter

### [Simple JWT](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
> pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt

### [DRF-yasg](https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg/)
